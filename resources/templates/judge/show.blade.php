    I will judge:
    Published (drop down yes/no)
    Maximum number of published (auto insert 5)
    Unpublished (drop down yes/no)
    Maximum number of unpublished (auto insert 6)
    Either (not both) I’ve indicated the max. number above (drop down yes/no)


    Unpublished entries will be accessed through a link sent after March 15th.
    Published books will be mailed, US and Canadian addresses only.
    If you want to judge published, please fill in the following:
     
    Due to the Daphne's growing popularity we often find some categories with more entries than expected and truly appreciate judges who are willing to take entries from more than one category to even out the distribution. If you can help in this way, please leave all preferences as Love to judge with the number of entries you are able to judge.
    If you have a definite preference for or against a category, please select Top Choice or Will Not Judge from the list

    Category Preferences
    If you have a definite preference for or against a category, please select Top Choice or Will Not Judge from the list.

    If you are entered in a published category, you can judge the unpublished division. If you are entered in an unpublished category, you can judge the published division. You will not be able to judge in the division and category you are entered. The new database will make this impossible.
