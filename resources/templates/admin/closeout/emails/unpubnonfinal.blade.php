<p>2015 Daphne Entrant:</p>

<p>The 2015 Daphne Contest first round judging has ended and unfortunately your entry did not final.  While this is disappointing, we hope you will keep in mind that contests are highly subjective, the Daphne is highly competitive, and what one judge loves, another doesn't.  We hope you will take this opportunity to look at the judge's comments.  Occasionally, they will make no sense to you, but other times you may actually have an Aha moment to make your manuscript better.  In any case, if two or more judges say the same thing, it may be a good idea to pay attention.  It is always, of course, your story.</p>

<p>In the rare case that your judge did not make comments, please be advised that the Overall Coordinator and Judge Coordinator keep track of these judges.  We cannot control everything in this contest, but we want to be first and foremost known as the contest that gives feedback.</p>

<p>If you wish to send a thank you note to your judge, you may send them to me and I will forward.</p>

<p>Thank you for entering the Daphne du Maurier Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense.  On behalf of the Daphne Committee, I wish you the very best in your writing career.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>{!!$coordinator!!}</p>
