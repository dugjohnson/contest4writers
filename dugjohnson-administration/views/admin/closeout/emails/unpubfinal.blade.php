<p>Dear {{ $contest_year }} Daphne Finalist:</p>

<p>The {{ $contest_year }} Daphne Contest has concluded and so we are now able to return your First-Round scores to you via our automated system.
	Your Final Round scores will come in a separate email and should arrive within the next day or so, if not sooner.</p>

<p>We hope you will keep in mind that contests are highly subjective, the Daphne is highly competitive,
	and what one judge loves, another doesn't. Occasionally, judges will make comments that will make no sense to you,
	but other times you may actually have an "Aha" moment to make your manuscript better.
	In any case, if two or more judges say the same thing, it may be a good idea to pay attention. It is always, of course, your story.</p>

<p>In the rare case that your judge did not make comments, please be advised that the Daphne Chair keeps track of these judges.
	We cannot control everything in this contest, but we want to be first and foremost known as the contest that gives feedback.</p>
<p>If you wish to send a thank you note to your judge, you may send them to me and I will forward.</p>

<p>Thank you for entering the Daphne du Maurier Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense. On behalf of the Daphne du Maurier Contest Committee, I wish you the very best in your writing career.</p>

<p>And again, Congratulations on being a {{ $contest_year }} Daphne Finalist!</p>

<p>To your writing success--<br/>
Erin</p>
<p>Erin Novotny<br/>
{{ $contest_year }} Daphne Contest Chair</p>
