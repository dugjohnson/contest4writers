<p>Dear Daphne du Maurier Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense Entrant:</p>
<p>From the website developer: You are getting an email for each score sheet because something that has worked
    in the past is now not working (as you've all seen) and we wanted to get you your score sheets while I work through
    why I have been unable to get the combined sheets in one email to work. I'm so sorry. It's a technical issue. You
    shouldn't be made to wait and multiple emails is my work around.</p>
<p>My sincere apologies, everyone. Once the scoresheets were released on Tuesday, June 21, we discovered there were a
    number of formatting issues. I am so sorry for the confusion and want to thank the folks that brought the errors to
    my attention. The issues have now been fixed so we are resending all of the scoresheets out again. If you have any
    questions, please let me know. </p>
<p>The {{ $contest_year }} Daphne Contest first round judging has ended, and the Unpublished Division Finalists have
    been announced. Unfortunately, you did not final.</p>

<p>While this is disappointing, we hope you will keep in mind that contests are highly subjective, the Daphne du Maurier
    Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense contest is highly competitive, and what one judge loves, another
    doesn't.</p>

<p>We hope you will take this opportunity to look at the judges’ comments. Occasionally, they will make no sense to you,
    but other times you may actually have an “Aha moment” to make your manuscript better. In any case, if two or more
    judges say the same thing, it may be a good idea to consider some editing. It is always, of course, your story.</p>

<p>In the rare case your judge did not make comments, please be advised that the Contest Co-Chairs and Coordinators keep
    track of these judges. We cannot control everything in this contest, but we want to be first and foremost known as
    the contest that gives feedback.</p>

<p>If you wish to send a thank-you note to your judges, you may send them to us and we will forward it.</p>

<p>Thank you for entering the {{ $contest_year }} Daphne du Maurier Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense contest.
