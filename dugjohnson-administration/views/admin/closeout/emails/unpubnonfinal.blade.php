<p>Dear Daphne Entrant:</p>

<p>The {{ $contest_year }} Daphne Contest first round judging has ended and unfortunately your entry did not final.</p>
<p>While this is disappointing, we hope you will keep in mind that contests are highly subjective,
    the Daphne is highly competitive, and what one judge loves, another doesn't.
    We hope you will take this opportunity to look at the judge's comments.
    Occasionally, they will make no sense to you, but other times you may actually have an "Aha moment" to make your manuscript better.
    In any case, if two or more judges say the same thing, it may be a good idea to consider some editing. It is always, of course, your story.</p>

<p>In the rare case that your judge did not make comments, please be advised that the Contest Chairman and Judge Coordinator keep track of these judges.
    We cannot control everything in this contest, but we want to be first and foremost known as the contest that gives feedback.</p>

<p>If you wish to send a thank-you note to your judge, you may send them to me and I will forward.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Daphne du Maurier Contest Committee, thank you for entering the Daphne du Maurier Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense.</p>
<p>I wish you the very best in your writing career.</p>

<p>Brooke</p>
