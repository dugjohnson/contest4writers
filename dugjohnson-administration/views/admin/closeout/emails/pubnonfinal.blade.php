<p>Dear Daphne Published Entrant:</p>

<p>The {{ $contest_year }} Daphne Published Contest has ended and unfortunately your entry did not final.
	This year's published contest, as always, was highly competitive. What one judge loves, another doesn't.
	Take this opportunity to look over the comments (if any) with an eye to maybe seeing an "Aha moment" you hadn't considered in
	your writing. Perhaps they will help in making the next book even better.
</p>
<p>If you wish to send a thank you note to your judge, you may send them to me and I will forward.
</p>
<p>Thank you for entering the Daphne du Maurier Award for Excellence in Mystery/Suspense.
	On behalf of the Daphne Committee, I wish you the very best in your writing career.
</p>

<p>Best,<br>
Brooke</p>
<p>Brooke Wills<br>
{{ $contest_year }} Daphne Contest Chair</p>
